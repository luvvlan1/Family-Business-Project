    <br>
    
    <p> This family business is owned by both second and third generation Puerto Ricans. Our culture is a huge factor in our lives and is widely important which is why we want to incorporate our flag into this business while also incorporting others. Despite being U.S. Citizens we still consider Puerto Rico it's own country and know well how it feels to miss home. Our family is very connected to the people, food, and provide a warm and welcoming environment. We value family, connection, and friendship and with this business we plan on creating an enviroment open to all, and naturally would love if the neighborhood and others came to visit often! </p>
