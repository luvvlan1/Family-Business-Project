    <!-- Here will be the proposal that goes into deeper detail of what the store will consist of, etc.-->
    
    
    <h3> The Proposal </h3>
      
    <p> Many U.S. Citzens, especially those of color move to the U.S.for new oppurtunities, but often many expierence the yearning for home. In the year 2023, the American Population statistics were revealed where we learn background information on residents in the U.S. and a lot more. </p> 
    
    <!-- Here is data that can help analyze who resides in the U.S.-->
    
    <h3> Statistics Found </h3>
    
    <p> In America, in 2023 alone, there were over 339,665,118 people. Additinally, of those people, there were an estimation of 78.2% english speakers,13.4% spanish speakers, 1.1% chinese speakers, and 1.0% other. As we look more into this data we see what the U.S. contains race and ethnicity wise. Here you can see the data:
      <br>
       <br>
      White
      61.6%
      <br>
      <p> The category of Hispanic is considered by the U.S. Census Bureau to be separate from racial categories, as people of Spanish/Hispanic/Latino origin may be of any race or ethnic group (white, black, Asian, etc.). An estimated 18.7% of the total US population is Hispanic as of 2020.</p>
        <br>
      Black or African American
      12.4%
     <br>
      <br>
      Asian
      6.0%
     <br>
       <br>
      Amerindian and Alaska Native
      1.1%
     <br>
      <br>
      Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander
      0.2%
       <br>
      Other
      8.4%
      <br>
       <br>
      Two or more races
      10.2%
    

  <p> Looking into this data we can see a variety of different people who reside in the U.S. You may be wondering how this is important to this family business? or how it contributes to it at all? Allow me to explain further. </p>

    <h3> How is this data relevant? </h3>
    
    <p> This data will help us see who resides in the U.S. as I said our store will have a variety of different foods. This data helps us target multiple audiences within the U.S. who long for a piece of home while living here. This can be significant and very beneficial to the people while also us, as we profit off of the things we put out for the people. Additionally, this store will be open to all - regardless of race and ethnic background, and will have reasonable pricing on each item. Our store will also include the money tags that way people can see the actual price, unlike some stores in CT (conveinience stores for ex.) prices vary depending on who's at the cashier and what they see fit for whatever it may be that there buying. Our goal is to avoid this problem. </p> 
  <br>
    <br>
    
    <p> Overall, this business will bring people together, provide afforadable products, avoid common problems among industries and lastly, become a sucessful business built from community and unity in a sense. </p>
