    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    
 <p> The Triple N Business. Triple N stands for Noelani, Noel, and Noah. It is a family business, meaning, those who work there will either be family or close friends. The store will be heavily influenced by culture, not only will it be Puerto Rican owned, but it will also incorporate the flags of others as well.</p>
   
    <h3> Inclusivity within the business </h3>
  
    <p> The store will consist of a variety of different foods, some from U.S. and others from other countries as a contribution to making the store multi-optional. A variety of foods can be found here, to provide inclusivity,etc. It will also include other things most traditional American corner stores have; like a deli area, beer, cigarettes, and things of that nature.</p>
    
    <h3> Staff </h3>
    
    <p> The owner of this Business will be Irvin Fuster, my father, because he came up with the name and obviously, can rightfully own a store and maintain it. Additionally, not all staff will be family some may be people who qaulified for the job or are family friends contributing to our cause. </p>
